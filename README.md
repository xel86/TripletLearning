# Triplet Constrained Representation Learning
Triplet Constrained Representation Learning is a method of organizing a corpus of text
into latent semantic groups based on relavancy to a predetermined notion. 
This project is being lead through a creative inquiry at Clemson University, and the proper explantaion of this method is explained
in full by the project lead, in this [PDF](https://github.com/bleusakura/TripletLearning/blob/main/resources/Triplet-Constrained%20Representation%20Learning.pdf)

## Roadmap
* Test our method on MNIST
  * Create triplet function based on Stochastic Triplet Embedding [✔]
  * Implement loss function based on triplet function in pytorch [   ]
  * Simulate researcher feedback with metacriteria for triplet labels [✔]
  * Compare our methods accuracy with others to determine usefulness [   ]
* Use refined method with textual dataset
  * Group based on latent semantic findings in the text
  * Researcher feedback loop with metacriteria to group uncertain groups
  * ?
* TBA
